# pyWordleSearch
python script to help me out in wordle.

## Simple flow

The idea is to type in a five letter word then type in the result returned from wordle where X is no match, Y is yellow for that position and G for green. 

### example

Enter word:  atone
Enter result: xyxxg

then the user will see a list of words that match that pattern and previous patterns as well and will keep looping until the result is all green or the user types exit.
